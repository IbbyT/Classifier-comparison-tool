# Classifier Comparison Tool

## Overview

The Classifier Comparison Tool is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to compare different machine learning classifiers on various datasets. Users can choose between datasets and classifiers, adjust classifier parameters, and visualize model performance and results.

## Features

- **Dataset Selection**: Choose from Iris, Breast Cancer, or Wine datasets.
- **Classifier Options**: Compare K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest classifiers.
- **Parameter Configuration**: Adjust classifier parameters through interactive sliders.
- **Model Evaluation**: Display accuracy and detailed classification reports.
- **Visualization**: View PCA-reduced 2D scatter plots of the dataset.
